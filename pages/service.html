                        <h2>Why I Value Service</h2>
                        <p>I believe it is important to support the community that supports you. I’m from a smaller town, so growing up I knew a lot of other families in the community. A simple outing like getting groceries could take hours because of how many friends my mom would bump into. When in a town like that, it’s easy to see what it means to be a community. Moving to a larger city, a sense of connection can be harder to feel at first. Volunteering is a great way to get that feeling back. When you directly see how your actions can affect others for the better, it makes you really understand what it means to be a community.</p>

                    <h2>Ten At A Time</h2>
                    <p>Ten at a Time is a nonprofit organization founded 9 of my friends and I when I was in high school. Once a month for 10 months of the year, we would each bring $10 of our own money, pool it together, making $100, and give it all to one member. The chosen member then uses the collective $100 in any way they want to contribute to a cause they believe would help our community. At the next meeting, the chosen member reports back to the group about their experience and what they decided to do with money. We then pool together another $100, choose a new member, and repeat.</p>

                    <h2>Habitat for Humanity Restore</h2>
                    <p>Habitat for Humanity ReStores are nonprofit home improvement stores and donation centers. People from all over the community can donate their furniture, appliances, and other home improvement items that they no longer need or have use for. Many of these items are used by <a href=https://www.habitat.org target="_blank">Habitat for Humanity</a>, an organization that helps rebuild communities after disasters, while the rest remains at the ReStore and is sold back to the community at discounted prices. I’ve spent many summer Saturdays volunteering at our local ReStore, helping unload, sort, and throw away donated items. While it was hard work, it was rewarding to see how the ReStore helped some of the less fortunate people in the community still be able to afford things like toilets and washing machines.</p>
