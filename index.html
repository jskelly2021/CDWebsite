                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Howdy! I am a Junior Computer Science Major at Texas A&M University. Recently, I have been focused on dipping my toes into as many areas of computer science I can. I’ve made IOS applications, built games in Unity, learned to render graphics with Vulkan, and I’ve explored the creating cloud environments in AWS. Next, I want to dive deeper into networks and computer systems. I am not afraid to try new things, I always keep an open mind, and I do my best to absorb all the information I can.</p>

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>I love sports like the NBA, NFL and College Football. Growing up, I played basketball, and I still love playing today. I just recently began playing golf which has taken up a lot of my time the past few months. I enjoy reading, playing videogames, and spending time with my friends. I love traveling, road trips, and seeing new places.</p>

                    <h2>Book Reviews</h2>
                    <p class="review">When I was a kid, I used to read every night before bed, but that stopped when I got to high school. Last summer, I decided I would pick that habit up and try to read at least 1 book a month. It’s been a few months now and reading has been a big part of my life ever since. I’ve read a few good and a few bad stories, so I thought I would rate some of these books and maybe share some thoughts. Ratings are out of 5 stars.</p>
                    <p>The Road by Cormac McCarthy - 3.75</p>
                    <p>The Terror by Dan Simmons - 4.50</p>
                    <p>The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson - 4.75</p>
                    <p>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon - 1.5</p>
                    <p class="review">This is quite literally the worst book I have ever read in my entire life. It is readable for approximately 30 pages, after that, I had to force myself to continue. The book is written from the perspective of a 13-year-old autistic boy who stumbles across his neighbor’s dog dead in her front yard, and he takes it upon himself to solve the mystery. That sounds interesting, but the fact that it is written entirely from the perspective of a 13-year-old boy, grammar and all, makes it get old incredibly fast. The “mystery” is solved not even halfway through the book. I was about to put it down and never read it again, but I decided to power through and skim the rest of the way just to see how it ends. There are zero likeable characters and nobody ends up happy. I’m giving this book an extra .5 stars because I at least skimmed the last half of the book. Otherwise, this would be 1 star. I recommend this book to nobody.</p>
